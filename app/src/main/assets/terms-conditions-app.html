                                    Apeerance offers a platform that connects attorneys seeking special appearance coverage for court appearances (“Clients”) with available one-time appearance attorneys (“Peers”). Clients and Peers (collectively, “Members”) are independent licensed attorneys in good standing with their respective state bars who are registered with Apeerance. Members are able to assign court appearances to Peers. Peers meet certain professional requirements and may therefore review and accept appearances for which they are qualified.  Apeerance covers liability insurance for these one-time appearances that are scheduled through the Apeerance product.
                                </p>

                                    <p>As a Client and/or Peer, you understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you (the “Charges”) which include the fee for the services of Client/Peer plus an administrative cost for the service provided by Apeerance. You will be advised of the Charges and asked to confirm before assigning an appearance through the Services. The Charges are subject to Apeerance’s Cancellation Policy (apeerance.com/cancellation). Those fees are subject to change without prior specific notice and you are responsible for knowing them.  The Apeerance application may or may not properly advise you of the fees.</p>
                                    <p>After you have received services from a Peer through your use of the Services, Apeerance will facilitate your payment of the applicable charges on behalf of the Peer. Stripe or other similar service, a third-party payments processor used by Apeerance, will charge the payment card you have added to your profile for this purpose. The Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Apeerance.</p>
                                    <p>After the Charges have been charged to your payment card you will receive a receipt from Apeerance by email. If your payment card is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree to update your payment card so that Apeerance may successfully complete the transaction and compensate your Peer accordingly.</p>
                                    <p>Apeerance reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise the Charges at any time in Apeerance’s sole discretion. Apeerance may from time to time provide certain members with promotional offers that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services from a Peer at any time prior to the time of the assigned appearance, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee. This payment structure is intended to fully compensate “Peers” for the services provided.</p>
                                    <p>You acknowledge and agree that Apeerance only facilitates the connection, communication, and payment between Client and Peer. Any and all substantive communication, services, and work relating to an appearance is between you and your Peer. Apeerance cannot and does not make any representations or guarantees concerning the quality and/or nature of the services provided by Peers. Apeerance does not have the right to, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you with regard to your provision of any Peer services. Apeerance may, in Apeerance’s sole discretion, investigate any concern regarding an appearance and determine whether or not to issue a partial or full refund of paid Charges.</p>
                                    <p>After you have received services from a Peer, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Peer. Any dispute regarding the quality and/or nature of services provided by a Peer must be addressed directly between you and your Peer unless otherwise provided for under these Terms.</p>

Therefore, Apeerance does not make any claims about quality, accuracy, legal sufficiency, legal enforceability, or appropriateness of Apeerance App or Services for your needs. If you require legal advice or help on your specific situation, you should consult a licensed attorney in your area.</p>
